Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
This repository is dedicated to Requirement Analysis in Software Development. It serves as a structured space to document, organize, and analyze software requirements, covering activities such as requirement gathering, modeling, and validation. The goal is to provide clarity between stakeholders and developers, ensuring that the system’s functional and non-functional needs are well understood before moving into design and implementation.
# What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a crucial phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) where the needs and expectations of stakeholders (clients, end-users, and business teams) are identified, analyzed, documented, and validated. It is the foundation of any software project because it defines what the system should do before moving into how it will be built.

In this phase, business analysts, project managers, and developers collaborate with stakeholders to gather requirements through techniques such as interviews, surveys, workshops, document reviews, and observations. These requirements are then modeled using tools like use case diagrams, data flow diagrams, and user stories to provide a clear picture of the system’s functionality.

The process usually includes four main activities:

Requirement Gathering/Elicitation – Collecting raw requirements from stakeholders.

Requirement Modeling – Structuring and representing the requirements visually or textually.

Requirement Analysis – Refining and prioritizing requirements to resolve conflicts or ambiguities.

Requirement Validation – Ensuring the requirements are complete, consistent, feasible, and aligned with business goals.
# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Clarity & Alignment → It creates a shared understanding between stakeholders and the development team, reducing miscommunication.

Cost & Time Efficiency → Detecting errors or missing requirements early is cheaper than fixing them later in design or coding.

Quality Assurance → Well-defined requirements ensure the final product meets user needs and business objectives.

Risk Reduction → Identifying potential issues early lowers the chances of project failure.

Better Planning → Clear requirements help in accurate project estimation (time, budget, resources).

In short, requirement analysis acts as the blueprint of the software project. Without it, development risks drifting away from stakeholder expectations, leading to wasted effort, cost overruns, and unsatisfied users.
